You can view the student's care plan from the future, current, and past perspectives. By default, when you click on a student, you will be brought to the In-Progress tab of the selected student's care plan.

A target will show up in the future, in progress, or past tab based on its status (link).

- Future
  - Goals without targets
  - Targets in the future status
  - Targets put on hold
- In Progress
  - Targets in the baseline status
  - Targets in the active status
  - Targets in the maintenance status
- Past
  - Mastered targets
  - A Goal that only has deactivated targets

Within each tab, goals and targets are sorted by domain. Every goal has a number representing the total number of targets within the goal.

Navigate to a student's care plan:

1. Click on "Students" in the bottom navigation bar
2. Select a student.
