## Add Targets to an Existing Goal  

1. On the Care Plan, click on a goal. 
2. Click the + icon in the bottom right corner.
3. Select one or multiple targets from your target list.
4. Import from the goal library or create a new goal.
5. Click Add.

The new targets will appear on the goal details page and in the future tab of the learner's care plan. 

## Configure Targets

Configure the target so that your team can address it in sessions. 

1. Click Edit on the Configurations tab of the target.
2. Click into the fields you want to edit and make the changes.
5. Click OK in the top right corner to save. 

The target will turn from "Future - Unconfigured" to "Future," enabling you to add baseline data or start the target as baseline.

:::note
Configuring a target clearly and completely is the best way to equip the behavior technician with the information they need to properly support the learner.
If you'd like to set up basic configurations just to start the target, and return to fill in other information at a later point, only the following configurations are required in order to start the target:
- Form of measure
- Minimum/expected trials (for forms of measure that offer trials)
- Intervention techniques (at least one per target)
- Mastery Criteria
