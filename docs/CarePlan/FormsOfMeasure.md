## Skill Acquisition Target Forms of Measure
Each skill acquisition target is configured with a form of measure. A BCBA chooses the form of measure by assessing how to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in influencing behavior change. 

### Percent Correct
Behavior technicians can collect data on *percent correct* targets from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by selecting Yes/No based on the learner's response to intervention.

A percent score is calculated based on correct trials out of total trials.

The score will not be plotted on the graph if the minimum trials defined in the target configuration was not collected. An orange * will indicate that you did not yet meet the minimum trials criteria.

### Task Analysis
Behavior technicians can collect data on *task analysis* targets from the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by selecting Yes/No based on the learner's demonstration of each step within a sequence of steps that constitutes a trial/skill.

A trial will be marked incomplete if data was not collected on all steps in the trial. Incomplete trials are not included in the score. 

The score is calculated based on the average of all complete trials. Trial scores are calculated as a percent based on correct steps out of total steps.

The score will not be plotted on the graph if the minimum trials defined in the target configuration was not collected. An orange * will indicate that you did not yet meet the minimum trials criteria.


### Count 
Behavior technicians can collect data on *count* (frequency) targets from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by selecting Add Count based on the learner's demonstration of the targeted skill.

### Duration

Behavior technicians can collect data *duration* targets by starting a timer at the onset of when the learner demonstrates the defined skill. You can pause, resume and stop the timer as necessary.

The score is either saved as the **Average Duration** of all occurrences of the target, or the **Total Duration** of all occurrences of the target, based on the duration type defined in the target configuration. A score is saved in hours, minutes, and seconds.

When the target is measured as **Average Duration**, there will be a minimum and expected trial criteria configured. The score will not be plotted on the graph if the minimum trials defined in the target configuration was not collected. An orange * will indicate that you did not yet meet the minimum trials criteria.

## Behavior Reduction Forms of Measure

A behavior can have one or more behavior objectives (reduce frequency, reduce duration, reduce rate, etc.).
The behavior objective displays under the behavior name on the target list.

### Count
Behavior technicians can collect data on *count* behaviors from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by pressing Add Count based on the learner's behavior occurrences.

The score is saved as the total counts for that target.

### Duration
Behavior technicians can collect data on *duration* behaviors by starting a timer when an occurrence of the behavior begins. You can pause the timer if you are unsure if the behavior occurrence has ended, and resume it if it continues, or stop the timer to finish that occurrence.

The score is either saved as the **Average Duration** of all occurrences of the behavior, or the **Total Duration** of all occurrences of the behavior, based on how the BCBA configured the behavior objective. A score is saved in hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Rate

**Session Duration as Observation Period**

Collect data on *rate* behaviors where the rate is measured over the session duration by pressing Add Count based on the learner's behavior occurrences. 

The score is saved as the total counts divided by the session duration.

The score is converted to per hour or per minute based on how the BCBA configured the mastery criteria.

:::noteExamples
- When 6 counts of a behavior are collected in a 45 minute session, and the mastery criteria is configured as per hour, the score will be saved as 8 per hour.
- When 35 counts of a behavior are collected in a 2 hour session, and the mastery criteria is configured as per minute, the score will be saved as 0.29 per minute.
:::

**Custom Observation Period**

Collect data on *rate* behaviors where the rate is measured over a custom observation period (configured by the BCBA) by starting a timer to indicate the observation period has started. Press "Add Count" based on the learner's behavior occurrences. The timer will continue running until it reaches the observation period configured by the BCBA. You can also pause the timer or stop the timer early if the observation period is interrupted for any reason.

The score is saved as the total counts divided by the duration the timer was running. When multiple occurrences of the observation period are collected, the score is calculated as the average rate from all occurrences.

The score is converted to per hour or per minute based on how the BCBA configured the mastery criteria.

:::noteExamples
- When 5 counts of a behavior are collected in a 1.5 hour observation period, and the mastery criteria is configured as per hour, the score will be saved as 3.33 per hour.
- When 22 counts of a behavior are collected in a 10 minute observation period, and the mastery criteria is configured as per minute, the score will be saved as 2.2 per minute.
- When 22 counts of a behavior are collected in a 10 minute observation period, and 14 counts of the same behavior are collected in another 10 minute observation period, and the mastery criteria is configured as per minute, the score will be saved as the average of the rates: 1.8 per minute (average of 2.2 and 1.4).
