## Edit a Goal 

You can edit a goal by clicking edit on the goal details page.  

## Remove Goal 

You can remove a goal from a learner's care plan if the goal has no targets associated with it. 

1. Click on a goal. 
2. Click “Edit” in the top right corner. 
3. Click Remove goal.
4. Confirm that you want to remove the goal from this learner's care plan. 

In case you want to remove a goal that has targets: 

- If none of the targets in the goal have data, remove the targets and then you will be able to remove the goal. 

- If there is a target in the goal that already has data, you will not be able to remove the goal completely. You can, however, deactivate the targets. A goal that only has deactivated targets will be displayed in the past tab. 

## Edit a Target 

:::note
In ABA, constant treatment planning based on data analysis is vital in order to maximize the impact of direct care sessions, remove barriers to treatment, and speed up progress. It's easy to tweak existing targets in your learner's care plan.

Once data is collected on a target, the form of measure cannot be edited, to preserve the accuracy and integrity of the existing data. Instead, [clone the target](../CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md/#clone-a-target) to create a new target on the same goal, and edit the form of measure on that target.

1. Click Edit in the top right corner. 
2. Click into the Form of Measure field and make the changes.
3. Click OK in the top right corner to save.
