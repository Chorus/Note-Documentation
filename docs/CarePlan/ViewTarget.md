You can open a target in the care plan to see its graph, history, and configuration.

View a target in a student's care plan:
1. Open the student's care plan
2. Locate the target
3. Click on the target to view

Configuration details are in the configuration tab while historical target data and events are listed in the history tab.

By default, a future target will open to the configuration tab and once the target has data, it will open to the history tab.

The target graph appears at the top of the page and is visible across both tabs. If the target has no data yet, there is no target graph.
