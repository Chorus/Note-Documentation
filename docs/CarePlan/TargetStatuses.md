To keep the care plan organized, every target has a status. You can see the status next to the target name and on the target details page. Statuses are color-coded to help you make sense of a care plan at a glance.

**Unconfigured:** Targets that are not configured. 

**Future Configured:** Targets that are configured but not started and wonâ€™t be displayed in direct care sessions. 

- You can configure targets in advance and start them once the student is ready. You also have the option to enter baseline data on a future target before including it in a direct care session. 

**Baseline:** Targets that need baseline data and are displayed in direct care sessions. 

**Active:** Targets that are being taught to the student and are displayed in direct care sessions.  

**Maintenance:** Targets that are being practiced by the student after the teaching is over and are displayed in direct care sessions.  

**Mastered:** Targets that have been mastered and are not displayed in direct care sessions. 

**On Hold:** In progress targets that are paused until the student is ready to acquire the skill. 

**Deactivated:** Targets that were started but are being discontinued because it is out of scope for the student. 

- A goal with deactivated targets only is displayed in the Past tab.
