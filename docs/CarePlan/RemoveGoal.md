title: Remove a Goal from the Care Plan
---
You can remove a goal from a student's care plan if the goal has no targets associated with it.

Remove a goal from the care plan:

1. Locate and open the goal
2. Click on the trash can icon at the top right corner of the goal page.
The trash can is only visible when the goal has no targets. If the trash can is not visible, see below.
3. Confirm that you want to remove the goal from this student's care plan

In case you want to remove a goal that has targets:

- If none of the targets in the goal have data, remove the targets (link) and then you will be able to remove the goal.
- If there is a target in the goal that already has data, you will not be able to remove the goal completely. You can, however, deactivate the targets (link). A goal that only has deactivated targets will come up in the past tab.
