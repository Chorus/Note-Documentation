## Target Statuses 
When a target is added to a student’s care plan, the target is in the future status until it is configured and started. When a target is started, it will be exposed to the assigned care team members for implementation in sessions. You can start the target in baseline mode and then activate the target after baseline is completed. Alternatively, you can enter baseline data while the target is in the future status and then start the target as an active target. The target remains active until it is marked as mastered or put in maintenance mode. A target can also be put on hold or deactivated. 

A student's care plan is organized based on target status. In the future tab, future and on hold targets are displayed. The In Progress tab holds targets that come up in sessions for data collection, including baseline, active, and maintenance targets. The Past tab is mainly for mastered targets. In case there is a goal that has deactivated targets only, the goal will appear in the past tab at the bottom of the list. 

A small icon indicating the target status is displayed for every target in a student’s care plan. The target status is also displayed on the target details page.
