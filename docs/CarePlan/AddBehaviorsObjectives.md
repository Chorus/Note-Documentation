## Add a Behavior 

You can quickly add one or multiple problem behaviors to a learner's care plan. 

1. On the Care Plan, tap the + icon in the bottom right corner.
2. Choose a problem behavior category.
3. Name the behavior or choose an existing behavior from your list.
4. Select the behavior(s) you want to add.
5. Tap "Add." 

The behavior is now added to the care plan. Configure a behavior by selecting a behavior and tapping “Configure” or Edit.

## Add an Objective 

An objective is the way the BCBA measures the behavior. A behavior needs to have an objective for it to be displayed in a direct care session. Not having an objective is like a target not having a form of measure.

5. Tap the objective on the behavior details page. 
6. Tap Configure objective or Edit. 
7. Configure the objective.

This will allow you to have multiple forms of measure for a behavior at the same time.
