Add targets to a care plan:

1. Click on "Students" in the bottom navigation bar
2. Click on a student
3. On the Care Plan, click on a goal
4. Click the "+" icon in the bottom right corner
5. Choose one or multiple targets from your target library.
      - You may browse and select from the public target library (link) or create a new target (link).

The new targets will appear on the goal details page and in the future tab of the student's care plan. Configure the target (link) so that your team can address it in sessions.
