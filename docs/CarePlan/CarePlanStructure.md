A care plan is organized in many ways in order to make it navigable and easy to use.  

<img src="/img/CarePlanStructure.png" width="650" />

The first level of organization is divided into three sections: 

**Future:** Targets that are not configured or not started and are not displayed in a direct care session. On hold targets and goals with no targets are also displayed here. 

**In Progress:** Targets that have a Baseline, Active or Maintenance status and are displayed in a direct care session. 

**Past:** Targets that are Mastered or Deactivated and are not displayed in a direct care session. 

The second level of organization is separating the problem behaviors and targets.  

The third level categorizes the targets by Domain > Goal > Target Status. 

The number next to the behavior tells you how many objectives there are in the behavior across all tabs and statuses. The same goes for the number next to the goal.
