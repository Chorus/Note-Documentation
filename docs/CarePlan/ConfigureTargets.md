## Configure Target and Objectives
After creating targets or objectives, configure the target/objective so that your team can address it in sessions. 

1. Click Edit on the Configurations tab of the target.
2. Click into the fields you want to edit and make the changes.
3. Click OK in the top right corner to save. 

The target will turn from "Future - Unconfigured" to "Future," enabling you to add baseline data or start the target as baseline.

:::note
Configuring a target clearly and completely is the best way to equip the behavior technician with the information they need to properly support the learner.
If you'd like to set up basic configurations just to start the target, and return to fill in other information at a later point, only the following configurations are required in order to start the target:
- [Form of measure](../CarePlan/FormsOfMeasure.md)
- Minimum/expected trials (for forms of measure that offer trials)
- Intervention techniques (at least one per target)
- Mastery Criteria

### Configure a Prompting Workflow on a Target

**Coming Soon!**

To configure a [prompting workflow](../CarePlan/FormsOfMeasure.md/#prompting-workflows) on a percent correct target:

1. Click Edit on the Configurations tab of the percent correct target.
2. Click Configure on the prompting workflow section
3. Set up the fields in the prompting workflow:
    - **Prompt Fading**
        - *Across Sessions* prompt fading will guide the behavior technician to use the first prompt level in the sequence until it is mastered and faded to the next prompt level in the sequence.
        - *Within Trials* prompt fading will allow the behavior technicians to try multiple prompt levels in a trial, and record which prompt level supported a correct response.
    - **Prompt Strategy** - choose whether the prompt levels are supporting a most to least prompt hierarchy, or a least to most prompt hierarchy.
    - **Prompt Levels** - add a custom prompt level, or click My Prompts to add to your personal prompt list or choose from prompts added in the past.
        - When adding a custom prompt level to this target or to your personal prompt list, you can set up a name for the prompt level and a description that will help the behavior technician understand how to prompt the learner.
        - For within trials prompt fading, set whether a correct response should be scored as correct. For example, when configuring an intrusive prompt level, you may want to set that it should not score as correct, so that the graph shows success from less intrusive prompt levels.
        - After adding prompt levels, drag and drop to put them in the order they should appear in during data collection- or, when fading across sessions, the order they should fade in.
        - Click on any of the prompt levels to edit the names or descriptions.
    - **Prompt Delay** - the prompt delay will show during data collection so the behavior technician knows how long to wait before recording a response.
    - **Mastery Criteria** - for across sessions prompt fading, select when the target should fade to the next prompt level in the sequence. To manage fading manually, turn off auto-fade.
4. Click OK in the top right corner to save the prompting workflow.
5. Click OK in the top right corner to save the target details.

## Clone a Target

1. On the Care Plan, click on a configured target.
2. Click the 3 dots icon in the top right corner.
3. Click Clone.
4. Select how many copies of the target you'd like.
5. Click Clone Target.

The copies will be parented under the same goal/subdomain/domain, and the same learner's care plan.
