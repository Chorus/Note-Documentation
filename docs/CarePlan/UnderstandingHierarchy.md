## Skill Acquisition

The structure of a skill acquisition target is: 

1. Domain 
2. Subdomain 
3. Goal 
4. Target 

The structured hierarchy creates an organized care plan and makes every student have the same structure.   

The domains and subdomains relate to core Autism deficits and are managed by the practice in Autism Care. 

You can create custom goals and targets and also utilize the goal and target library. 
 

## Problem Behavior

The structure of a problem behavior is: 

1. Category 
2. Problem Behavior 
3. Objective (Form of Measure)
