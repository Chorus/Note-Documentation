## General Configuration 
Every target in a student’s care plan has the following configuration options: 
-	*Assignment* – You can assign the target to members of the student’s care team. The target will only come up in sessions of assigned care team members. This helps you ensure that targets are only addressed by trained personnel. It also narrows down the list of targets in a session. 
-	*Priority* – You can mark a target as high priority. High priority targets are listed before other active targets in session. 
-	*Form of measure* – You can select the form of measure. Additional configuration fields are based on the selected form of measure. 
o	The form of measure cannot be changed once the target has data. 
 
## Minimum and Expected Trials 
With DTT and other forms of measure, data is collected for a number of trials. You have the option to configure the minimum and expected number of trials to be entered. 
-	*Minimum trials* – This is the minimum number of trials that must be entered for a valid score. If less than minimum trials were entered, then the resulting score is invalid. 
o	An invalid score will not be graphed and will not count towards the number of targets completed during the session. An invalid score should not count towards mastery. 
-	*Expected trials* – This is the number of trials that is expected of the provider to perform when addressing the target. It is not required to complete the expected number of trials, but users are encouraged to do so. Users will see progress with expected number of trials while collecting data. 
 
## DTT Configuration 
Configuration options for discrete trial training: 

*Observation*
-	Minimum trials 
-	Expected trials 

*Mastery Criteria*
-	Minimum score 
-	Number of consecutive sessions 

*Teaching Instructions*
-	SD (Discriminative Stimulus) 
-	Required Materials 
-	Instructions 


## Task Analysis Configuration 
Task analysis is for breaking up a single task into smaller steps. The steps must all be completed in order to get the task done. 
Note that when using task analysis all steps need to be completed for a valid score, and the user cannot change the order of steps when collecting data. 
 
Configuration options for task analysis: 

*Observation*
-	Minimum trials 
-	Expected trials 

*Mastery Criteria*
- Minimum score 
- Number of consecutive sessions 

*Teaching Instructions* 
- Steps  - At least 2 steps are required. 
- Required Materials 
- Instructions
