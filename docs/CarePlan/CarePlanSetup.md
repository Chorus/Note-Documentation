Select a student from the student list to view and manage the care plan.
A care plan is divided into three sections: 

**Future:** Targets that are not configured or not started and are not displayed in a direct care session. On hold targets and goals with no targets are also displayed here. 

**In Progress:** Targets that have a Baseline, Active or Maintenance status and are displayed in a direct care session. 

**Past:** Targets that are Mastered or Deactivated and are not displayed in a direct care session.

## Care Plan Structure

### Skill Acquisition Targets

A skill acquisition target is made up of: 

1. Domain 
2. Subdomain 
3. Goal 
4. Target 

:::note
The domains and subdomains relate to core Autism deficits and are managed by your agency.
The structured hierarchy creates an organized care plan and ensures every student's care plan has the same structure.   
:::

You can create custom goals and targets and also utilize the goal and target library. 
- [Add Goals and Targets](CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md)
- [Goal and Target Libraries](CarePlan/GoalTargetLibraries.md)

### Problem Behaviors

A problem behavior is made up of: 

1. Behavior Category 
2. Behavior 
3. Objective

- [Add Behaviors and Objectives](CarePlan/AddBehaviorsObjectives.md)

:::note
The number next to the goal tells you how many targets there are in the goal across all tabs and statuses, so you can better understand how many prerequisite skills lead up to the long-term goal.

The number next to the behavior tells you how many objectives there are in the behavior across all tabs and statuses, so you can better understand how many objectives are being tracked per behavior.
