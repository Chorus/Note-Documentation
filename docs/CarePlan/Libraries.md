## Goal Library 

You can create and manage your own private goal library in Note. This is called your “Goal List” and will be available when you add goals to a student’s care plan. Your goal list is organized by domain and subdomain. While domains and subdomains are managed by your organization, the goal list within each subdomain is created and managed by you.  

Your goal list is the list of goals that will be available for you to select from across all your students. You can add goals to your list by creating a custom goal or by importing from a shared library of goals.  

You may have access to a shared library of goals from which you can import goals into your own goal list. This is called the “Goals Library” and is managed by your organization. You will see a link on your goal list to browse the library if it is available.  
Goals that are added to your goal list will remain in your list unless you remove them. Keep frequently used goals in your list so that you don’t have to recreate or fetch them again for other students. 

To view or maintain your goal list within a subdomain, click the + button on a student’s care plan and navigate to that subdomain. You will see your goal list for the selected subdomain. You can click Edit to rename or remove existing goals from your list.  

Note: Changes made to your goal list will only effect what you see in your list when adding goals to a student’s care plan in the future. It will have no effect on existing goals in a student’s care plan. 

## Target Library 
For each goal in your goal list, you can create and manage your own private target library. This is called your “Target List” and will be available when you add targets to that goal in a student’s care plan. 
Your target list is the list of targets that will be available to you across all your students when adding targets to a goal in the care plan. You can add targets to your list by creating a custom target or by importing from a shared library of targets. 

If you are in a goal which was imported from a shared library, you may have access to a shared library from which you can import targets. This is called the “Target Library” and is managed by your organization. You will see a link on your target list to browse the library if it is available. 

Targets that are added to your target list will remain in your list unless you remove them. Keep frequently used targets in your list so that you don’t have to recreate or fetch them again for other students. 

To view or maintain your target list within a goal, open that goal from within a student’s care plan and click the + button. You will see your target list for that goal. You can click Edit to rename or remove existing targets from your list.  

Note: Changes made to your target list will only effect what you see in your list when adding targets to a student’s care plan in the future. It will have no effect on existing targets in a student’s care plan.
