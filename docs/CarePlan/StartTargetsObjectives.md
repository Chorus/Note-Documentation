After a target is configured, start the target to move it from future to in progress (baseline, active, or maintenance) so that the behavior technician will be able to collect data for it on sessions.

There are 2 options for starting targets:

1. Start as baseline
2. Add baseline data to the graph, then start as active

## Start as Baseline

1. Click a Future target.
2. Click Start target.
3. Confirm you’d like to start the target as Baseline.

The target phase will move from Future to Baseline, and the target will show on the In Progress tab of the care plan. The target will show on direct care sessions going forward.

Data collected while the target is in the baseline phase will be saved as baseline data.

## Start as Active

1. Click a Future target.
2. On the graph, click Add baseline data.
3. Select the score and adjust the date as needed.
4. Click OK to save.
5. Click Start target.
6. Choose new target phase (baseline or active).

If you choose Active, the target phase will move from Future to Active, and the target will show on the In Progress tab of the care plan. The target will show on direct care sessions going forward.

## Activate Targets

Baseline targets can be activated once there is baseline data collected.

1. Open a Baseline target with data collected.
2. Click Activate target.
3. Confirm by clicking Activate.
