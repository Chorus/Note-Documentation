# Note 1.4.31 - April 2025

- **Interactive Activity Report**: the [activity report](../Reports/ActivityReport.md) you love just got better! Now, you can open a target directly from the activity report to make the relevant updates.
    - ðŸ“ˆSee a high average score? Tap on the target to go to the target details and move it to maintenance.
    - ðŸ“‰See a target without activity recently? Tap on the target to go to the target details and set it as high priority.
    - Click back and return to where you were scrolled to on the activity report for effortless data analysis!

- **Geolocation Tracking for All Service Types**: If your organization requires EVV (electronic visit verification), exact geolocation will be tracked at the start and end time of your session. Youâ€™ll be asked if the app can access your exact location if your organizationâ€™s policy requires it.

- Additional validations to ensure every session has a [session note](../Session/SessionNotes.md).

- Easier [installation on Windows PCs](../GettingStarted/DownloadNote.md/#windows-pcs)!
