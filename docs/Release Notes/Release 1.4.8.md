# Note 1.4.8 - July 2024

- **Phase Change Lines!** Whenever the [phase](../CarePlan/TargetPhases.md/#change-a-targets-phase) (previously called “status” in Note) of a target is updated, a solid vertical line is plotted on the graph on that date. [Edit a Phase Change date](../CarePlan/TargetPhases.md/#edit-a-phase-change-date) by selecting the phase change from the target history and adjusting the date.

- Maintenance targets are labeled in green to distinguish them from active targets (blue) during data collection.

- Baseline data can be added to behavior objectives.

- When configuring task analysis targets, the Add Steps page scrolls properly, allowing more than 15 steps can be configured.
