You can see the graph of a target by clicking on a target in a care plan. Graphs enable the BCBA to see a clientâ€™s progress plotted on a graph.

The Y axis labels change based on the form of measure and the X axis displays the dates. You can zoom in and out on the graph to control how many dates are being displayed and go back or forward in time by tapping and dragging your finger horizontally.  

The filter, in the top right corner, can be used to view specific data points on the graph. You can also add a phase change and a data point here.  

Under the History tab, you can see all activity regarding the target:  

- All status changes 
- Phase changes 
- Data points from sessions 
- Manually added data points
