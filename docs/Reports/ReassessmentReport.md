## Assessment Data

Data from your learnerâ€™s care plan is automated into the report to ensure accuracy and boost efficiency. 

### Skill Acquisition Data

Each skill acquisition Domain is printed with your organization's Domain description, followed by 3 tables listing targets in this domain. 
- A target will not be listed on the report if there was no data collected on it within the selected authorization period. 
- For initial assessments, input baseline data in the care plan before generating the report.

*Mastered Goals and Objectives*: targets updated to Mastered within the selected authorization period

| Subdomain  | Goal | Target | Date Mastered | Included in Group Session |
