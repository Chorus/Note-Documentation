## Target Forms of Measure
Each skill acquisition target is given a form of measure. The form of measure controls how you are able to collect data on that target.

### Percent Correct
Collect data on percent correct targets from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by pressing Yes/No based on the learner's response to intervention.

The score is calculated based on correct out of total trials.

The score will not be plotted on the graph if the minimum trials that the BCBA defined was not collected. An orange * will indicate that you did not yet meet the minimum trials criteria.

### Task Analysis
Collect data on task analysis targets from the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by pressing Yes/No based on the learner's response to intervention for each step of each trial.

A trial will be marked incomplete if data was not collected on all steps in the trial. Incomplete trials are not included in the score.

The score is calculated based on the average of all complete trials. Trials are calculated based on correct out of total steps.

The score will not be plotted on the graph if the minimum trials that the BCBA defined was not collected. An orange * will indicate that you did not yet meet the minimum trials criteria.


### Count
Collect data on count targets from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by pressing Add Count based on the learner's response to intervention.

### Duration

**Average Duration**

**Total Duration**

## Behavior Forms of Measure

A behavior can have 1 or more behavior objectives (reduce frequency, reduce duration, reduce rate, etc.).
The behavior objective displays under the behavior name on the target list.

### Count
Collect data on count behaviors from the [target list](../DataCollection/DataCollectionOnTargetList.md) or the [target card](../DataCollection/DataCollectionTargetCard.md) by pressing Add Count based on the learner's behavior occurrences.
