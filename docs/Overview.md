The main navigation is divided into three components: **Sessions**, **Students** and **Settings**.

**Sessions** serves as your personal calendar and provides relevant tools for your daily schedule. **Students** allows you to create and manage your student's care plans. **Settings** enables you to reset your password and PIN, as well as syncing your device.

## Sessions

When you open the app, you will see your upcoming sessions. You can view your sessions by day, week, or month and have the ability to navigate to other dates. You can click the + button to create a new session.

Within each session you will see a General tab with the session details and an Observations tab with the applicable features for that session. For example, there will be a list of targets for data collection in a direct care session and space to write session notes for treatment planning.

### Navigate to a session:

1. Tap on Sessions in the bottom navigation bar.
2. Select a session.


## Students

In Students, you will see the student list, which is created and maintained by the agency. Select a student to see the student's care plan, profile, and sessions.

In a student's care plan, you can manage all the goals and targets for the student for both skill acquisition and behavior reduction. In the sessions tab within a student, you can see all sessions from the entire care team for this student. In the student profile you will find basic information about the student, such as date of birth and parent's contact information.

### Navigate to a student:

1. Tap on Students in the bottom navigation bar.
2. Select a student.

You will see active goals and targets in the Care Plan with the ability to switch between the future, in progress and past tabs. You can also see the student's profile and sessions.

## Settings

In Settings, you can see when the app last synced with the agency's database. You can trigger a sync to get and send the most updated information.
