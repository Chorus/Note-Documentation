## Edit a Behavior 

In ABA, constant treatment planning based on data analysis is vital in order to maximize the impact of direct care sessions, remove barriers to treatment, and speed up progress. It's easy to tweak existing behaviors in your student's care plan. 

1. On the Care Plan, click on a behavior 

2. Click "Edit" in the top right corner 

3. Click into the fields you want to edit and make the changes 

4. Click "OK" in the top right corner to save 

## Remove a Behavior 

You can remove a behavior from a student's care plan if the behavior doesn’t have an objective with data associated with it. 

1. Click on a behavior 

2. Click “Edit” in the top right corner 

3. Click “Remove behavior” 

4. Confirm that you want to remove the behavior from this student's care plan 

If you want to remove a behavior that has an objective with data, you can deactivate the objective(link). A behavior that only has deactivated objectives will be displayed in the past tab.
