title: Add, Edit and Remove Objectives

An objective is the way the BCBA measures the behavior. A behavior needs to have an objective for it to be displayed in a direct care session. Not having an objective is like a target not having a form of measure.

## Add an Objective 

1. Click on a behavior 

2. Click the “+” button in the bottom right corner 

3. Choose the objective 

4. Click OK to save 

5. Click into the objective on the behavior details page 

6. Click “Configure objective” or “Edit” 

7. Configure the objective 

8. Click OK to save 

This concept allows you to have multiple forms of measure for a behavior at the same time.  

## Edit an Objective  

In ABA, constant treatment planning based on data analysis is vital in order to maximize the impact of direct care sessions, remove barriers to treatment, and speed up progress. It's easy to tweak existing objectives in your student's care plan. 

1. On the Care Plan, click on a behavior 

2. Click on the objective you want to edit 

3. Click "Edit" in the top right corner 

4. Click into the fields you want to edit and make the changes 

5. Click "OK" in the top right corner to save 

## Remove an Objective 

You can remove an objective from a student's care plan if it doesn’t have data associated with it. 

1. On the Care Plan, click on a behavior 

2. Click on the objective you want to remove 

3. Click "Edit" in the top right corner 

4. Click “Remove objective” 

5. Confirm that you want to remove the objective from this student's care plan 

If you want to remove an objective that has data, you can deactivate it (link). A behavior that only has deactivated objectives will be displayed in the past tab.
