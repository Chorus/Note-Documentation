On the Settings page, you can: 
- View when your account last synced.
- Manually sync your account.
- Access this Documentation site through the “Help Center” button.
- Check that you are using the most updated version of the app (1.4.2 on mobile, 1.4.2949.2 on PC).
- Sign out of your account.

## Sync
Syncing is the process that allows all the data to be shared with different devices and providers on the care team.

**Keep in mind**

- When logging into the app, it is necessary to be connected to a stable network to ensure that any data added on a different device is being displayed on yours. 

- If you don’t have service after logging in, the data will be saved on the device, and the app will sync the next time the device is connected to a network. 

You can manually sync your account by going to the Settings tab and clicking "Sync now" while the device is connected to a network.
