## Edit a Target 

In ABA, constant treatment planning based on data analysis is vital in order to maximize the impact of direct care sessions, remove barriers to treatment, and speed up progress. It's easy to tweak existing targets in your student's care plan. 

1. On the Care Plan, click on a target. 
2. Click Edit in the top right corner. 
3. Click into the fields you want to edit and make the changes.
4. Click OK in the top right corner to save. 

## Remove a Target 

1. You can remove a target from a student's care plan if the target has no data associated with it. 
2. Click on a target. 
3. Click Edit in the top right corner. 
4. Click Remove target.
5. Confirm that you want to remove the target from this student's care plan.

In case you want to remove a target that has data, you can deactivate the targets. A goal that only has deactivated targets will be displayed in the past tab.
