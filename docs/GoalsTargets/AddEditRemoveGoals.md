## Add a Goal

2. Choose a domain 
3. Choose a subdomain 
4. Import from the goal library (link) or create a new goal (link) 
5. Select a goal from your goal list 
6. Choose to add the targets later or select the targets and click “Add” 

The new goal will appear in the future tab of the student's care plan. 

 ## Edit a Goal 

You can edit a goal by clicking edit on the goal details page.  


## Remove Goal 

You can remove a goal from a student's care plan if the goal has no targets associated with it. 

1. Click on a goal 
2. Click “Edit” in the top right corner 
3. Click “Remove goal” 
4. Confirm that you want to remove the goal from this student's care plan 

In case you want to remove a goal that has targets: 

- If none of the targets in the goal have data, remove the targets (link) and then you will be able to remove the goal. 

- If there is a target in the goal that already has data, you will not be able to remove the goal completely. You can, however, deactivate the targets (link). A goal that only has deactivated targets will be displayed in the past tab.
