A session note is a detailed summary of what occurred during your session and how it impacts the learner's overall progress.

Any detail you include in your session note will be submitted to insurance and available to your BCBA. 

## Direct Sessions

After collecting data on your direct care session, complete the session note before submitting your session.

There are 4 sections in a Direct Care session note:

- **Participants**: Select and add the participants who were present at your session. 
    
    You can include names of additional participants in parentheses after the title of the participant: "Sister (Alice Smith)", "Father (Bob Smith)"
- **Session Insights**: This section categorizes the data you collected so that you can understand how it affects the overall progress on each target.
    - Improving Scores: higher scores than the previous data point on that target.
    - Regressing Scores: lower scores than the previous data point on that target.
    - Incomplete Scores: scores where the minimum trials configured by the BCBA for that target were not collected.
    - Problem Behaviors: behaviors that occurred during the session.
- **Setting Events**: Include observable and measurable details that may have interfered with your session or possibly impacted the increase in occurrence or intensity of problem behaviors.
- **Preferences and Reinforcers**: Include observable and measurable details about the preferences and reinforcers utilized during the session.
    - Preferences include tangible and intangible stimuli that a learner may demonstrate interest in. This may include items selected for an intervention.
    - Reinforcers include tangible and intangible stimuli delivered to a learner upon demonstration of a desired behavior to increase future likelihood of its occurrence.
