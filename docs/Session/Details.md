You can open a session to view details. General details, like the date and time of the session, can be found in the General tab. Session notes or data collected during the session can be found in the Observations tab.

In the General tab of a session you will see:

- The session status (see session status-link)
- Date of the session
- Start time and time
- Duration
- Student
- Provider
- Service type
- Location

In the Observations tab of a session you can record and view session data. For a direct care session, you can collect data on the day of the session. For other session types, you can enter session notes. Once your observations are noted, you can come back here at any time to view recorded session data.
