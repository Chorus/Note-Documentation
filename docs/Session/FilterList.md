You can filter the list of sessions displayed by status, service type, and location.

## Filter the sessions list:

1. Click on the filter icon.
2. Select the filters you want to apply.
3. Click Apply.

Tip: To filter out one item you can click 'Select all' on the filters popup and then deselect the type of session you want to remove from the list.

## Remove filters:

1. Click on the filter icon.
2. Deselect the filters you want to remove. You can click "Deselect all" to deselect all filters.
3. Click Apply.
