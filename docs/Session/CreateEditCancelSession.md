Sessions scheduled for you by your organization will appear on your session list.

3. Click OK to save the session. 

Your session is saved and will be validated by your organization. The session status will be updated throughout the process.

When creating a session and selecting the service to schedule, you can view how many hours you are assigned to per week/month/assignment period, how many hours were already scheduled, and how many are remaining.
