## View my schedule

Sessions can be viewed by day, week, or month. By default, when you open the app, you will see your sessions for the current week. Your sessions for the week will be scrolled so that today's sessions are in the viewport. This was designed to give you a glance of today's schedule and make your upcoming sessions accessible as soon as you open the app.

You can switch to the day view or month view and you can navigate forward or backward in time. From anywhere in your sessions list, you can get back to today's sessions with a single click.

You can also filter the list of sessions displayed by status, service type, and location.

## Change the view

1. Click on the tabs at the top to change the view from week to day or month.

## Navigate to another date

1. Click on the right or left arrow next to the date range to navigate forward or backward in time.

When viewing sessions by day, the arrows will redirect you to the next or previous day. When viewing sessions by week, the arrows will redirect you to the next or previous week.

## Navigate back to today

1. Click \_ to navigate back to today from anywhere in your sessions list.

Navigating back to today will not change the view. When viewing sessions by week, clicking the icon will bring you back to this week's sessions. When viewing sessions by month, clicking the icon will bring you back to this month's sessions. The list will automatically scroll, if necessary, so that today's sessions are visible.
