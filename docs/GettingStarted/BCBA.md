New to Note? We've got you covered! Here's a quick start to adding, configuring, and activating targets in Note!

:::note Quick Start
1. First, learn about how a Note care plan is structured: [Care Plan Structure](CarePlan/CarePlanSetup.md/#care-plan-structure)
2. Next, you can add your first target.
    - [Add Goals and Targets](CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md)
    - [Demo video: Add a Goal and Targets to a Care Plan](https://youtu.be/_DCx4QZ3VQA "Title")
3. After that, you'll need to configure the target. Don't forget to check out which configurations are required!
    - [Configure Targets](CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md/#configure-targets)
    - [Forms of Measure](CarePlan/FormsOfMeasure.md)
4. Nice, you've configured the target! When you're ready, you can start it as baseline or active: [Start Targets](CarePlan/StartTargetsObjectives.md)
5. Did you mean to start the target yesterday, when the BT started? No problem- simply edit the created and baseline/active phases to the day before the BT needed the target.
    - [Edit a Phase Change Date](CarePlan/TargetPhases.md/#edit-a-phase-change-date)
    - [Tutorial: Managing Phase Changes](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXBkZWbjU/oX76yJfeVK0KW1aB3QsF0g/view?utm_content=DAGXBkZWbjU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer)
