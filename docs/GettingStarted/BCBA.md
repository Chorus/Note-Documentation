New to Note? We've got you covered! Here's a quick start to adding, configuring, and activating targets in Note!

:::note Quick Start
1. First, learn about how a Note care plan is structured: [Care Plan Structure](CarePlan/CarePlanSetup.md/#care-plan-structure)
2. Next, you can add your first target.
    - [Add Goals and Targets](CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md)
    - [Demo video: Add a Goal and Targets to a Care Plan](https://youtu.be/_DCx4QZ3VQA "Title")
3. After that, you'll need to configure the target. Don't forget to check out which configurations are required!
    - [Configure Targets](CarePlan/AddGoalsTargets.md/#configure-targets)
    - [Forms of Measure](CarePlan/FormsOfMeasure.md)
4. Nice, you've configured the target! When you're ready, you can start it as baseline or active: [Start Targets](CarePlan/StartTargetsObjectives.md)
5. Did you mean to start the target yesterday, when the BT started? No problem- simply edit the created and baseline/active phases to the day before the BT needed the target.
    - [Edit a Phase Change Date](CarePlan/TargetPhases.md/#edit-a-phase-change-date)
    - [Tutorial: Managing Phase Changes](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXBkZWbjU/oX76yJfeVK0KW1aB3QsF0g/view?utm_content=DAGXBkZWbjU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer)

<summary> How to see your BT's target list</summary>

Want to double-check the targets are showing on your BT's session? Open the BT's session from the Learner Sessions List:

1. Go to the Learner's tab
2. Click on a learner
3. Go to the Sessions tab at the top of the screen to see all sessions for this learner.
4. Open the BT's session. The observations tab shows targets that were started (as baseline or active) before the date of the session.
