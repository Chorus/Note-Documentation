## Using NOTE


**Do I still need to use Catalyst for data collection?**

No. The NOTE app will be your only source of data collection and you do not need to access Catalyst anymore. If you are experiencing any technical difficulty with the NOTE app, please reach out to the office immediately. Do not take data on Catalyst instead.
 
**Do I need to have internet access each time I use the app?:** 

No. The NOTE app was created so it can work in locations without any internet access. Once you are in the vicinity of your WIFI/data, the app will update. You can always check when the last sync update was by navigating to the Settings tab. 

**Will all previous goals that were entered in Catalyst be transferred to the app?**
Current, as well as previous goals will be not transferred. We are offering 1 hour of non-billable time per client to set up the Care Plan under the NOTE app.

**Can I still view the goals in Catalyst, or will the system not work anymore?** 
BCBAs will have “view only” access so they are able to see previous goals and note what was previously addressed in treatment. 

 **What happens if my client is in middle of an authorization- how do I navigate the data in two places?**

When entering the Care Plan, take all goals in progress and add the baseline level to the goals which will be the current level of progress of an existing goal. All new goals can be properly added with baseline levels. When it comes to goal reporting, you will need to access Catalyst for the baseline levels but can view the current levels on the graph in the NOTE app. 

**Do I still need access to the portal, or can I use the app exclusively?**

You will use the Encore Portal to invoice and generate a Treatment Plan Update Report. 

**How do I access my Treatment Plan Update Report?**

Treatment Plan Updates are available to access on the Encore Portal. The fields will be the same as you have done previously. Please refer to the tutorial for step-by-step guidance. 


 **Can I use multiple devices to access the app?**

Only BCBAs can use a mobile device as well as a desktop version. We discourage multiple users sharing one device since we want to ensure that all information is synced and signing in and out prior to syncing the data can cause data to be lost. 



## Navigating the App


**I can’t see one particular student on the app to set up their Care Plan, what do I do?** 

Speak to the office to ensure that you were assigned this client and there are no assignment issues. 

 **I set up a goal, but I’m not sure why it’s not yet in progress, what do I do?**

 Be sure that you created a target as well. NOTE app is set up that you need to create a preset domain and subdomain as well as a goal AND target. If you already set up a target and do not see it in progress, it’s possible that you did not complete all mandatory target configurations. 

**When do I add the target configurations?** 

Whenever you set up a goal and target, you can leave it in the “future” status until you are ready to make it an active goal. Target configurations must be set up before a target is in baseline.  

**Which target configuration fields are mandatory?**

 All the target configurations are mandatory aside from the target instructions which include SD, Procedure and Required Materials. Although it is best practice of ABA to fill out all fields, you can set up the optional fields later, so your BTs know exactly how to run all targets.

 **How do I set up maladaptive behaviors?** 

Maladaptive Behaviors are set up like skill acquisition targets. Just follow the prompts to select a behavior category and individualize the behavior name as well as the form of measure to track the behavior. 

 **How does a target move from status to status?**

You can view the target configurations, select “edit” and change the status to that of your liking. Only the available statuses will be able to be selected. See question below if you do not see a status available to select. 

 **When will I get the options of moving goals from status to status?** 
 The default status is future unconfigured. Once configurations are set up you, will then have the option to change the target’s status to baseline. After at least 1 day of baseline, you can move the status to active/in progress. You must have at least two days of in progress data before you will be able to master the target/ place it on hold/deactivated it or put the goal on maintenance. Once a target is mastered or deactivated, you can always move it back to in progress. Goals on hold can be moved to in progress as well. 

**My app is going very slow- what do I do?**

Try securing proper internet connection. If you still encountering difficulties, close the app and restart it. Reach out to notesupport@chorus.cloud if the issue persists.  


## Feature questions
**Am I able to see my sessions that were created on the portal, on the NOTE app?**

 Yes! For your convenience, the Encore portal and the NOTE app work in sync and you will be able to view all sessions on both platforms. 

**Is there a way to save goals that can be seen for multiple clients?**

 Yes. Once a goal/target is created for one student, you will be able to view it for all of your students. 

 **Can I “clone” a target and change a specific feature?**
Once a target is created, you will be able to add it again. You will then be able to modify the target name to your liking.
