The main navigation is divided into two components: **Sessions** and **Students**.

**Sessions** serves as your personal calendar and provides relevant tools for your daily schedule, while **Students** allows you to delve into a specific student's care.

## Sessions

When you open the app, you will see your sessions for the week. You can view your sessions by day, by week, or by month and navigate to other dates. You can create click the + button to create a new session.

Within each session you can see general session details and note your observations. All applicable features, such as data collection for a direct care session, will be available from within the session.

Navigate to a session:

1. Click on Sessions in the bottom navigation bar
2. Click on a session.

You will see details about the session in the General tab. The Observations tab is for your observations during the session, or session notes. This is where you will find tools you may need during a session, like data collection features.

## Students

In Students you will see the student list, which is created and maintained by the agency. Select a student to see the student's care plan, profile, and sessions.

In the student's care plan, you can manage all your goals and targets for the student for both skill acquisition and behavior reduction.
